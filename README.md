System Tests Corresponding to API: <br>
Iteration 1:
  Link: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14290543/UVC9gkKY <br>
  We used Postman test suite to run the integration tests. The API entry points are implemented in ClubsController, EventsController, StudentsController. <br>
  Postman collection json: https://github.com/SoamyaAgrawal17/SAVS/blob/main/SAVS.postman_collection.json <br>
  Postman run result : https://github.com/SoamyaAgrawal17/SAVS/blob/main/SAVS.postman_test_run.json <br>
 
Iteration 2:
  Authentication Suite Doc Link: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14290543/UVR5po3o
  Test Suite Doc Link: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14290543/UVR4PqZQ
  We used Postman suite to run the complete integration tests. Before running the test suite, we run authentication suite. This includes all entry points that are implemented.Postman authentication and test suites are located in the shared Postman workspace.
  Postman run result: https://github.com/SoamyaAgrawal17/SAVS/blob/main/SAVS%20Final%20Integration%20Test%20suite.postman_test_run.json

Unit Tests: <br>
Command to run unit test: coverage run -m unittest discover test <br>
We have covered all the methods implemented in ClubService, EventService, and StudentService. <br>
For Controller methods, we have used the above System Tests. Unit tests for Controllers is planned to be implemented as part of the next iteration. <br>

Style-compliant: <br>
We used the command flake8 application>bugs.txt and flake8 test>bugs1.txt. We have fixed all the major bugs as part of this iteration. <br>
This is also added to CI pipeline.

Build, run, test instructions: <br>
We have deployed the code on Heroku. And below are the configurations for the same.  <br>
Configuration: <br>
Endpoint: https://savs-project-final.herokuapp.com/ <br>
Production Database: postgresql://xbasblmhnpkibi:8a1264b9c4b71b4c8abac23f12fc7a991e3fe81671b1169a0d09c6692f7606f4@ec2-18-207-72-235.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d1qeu6i6agoejb <br>
Test Database: postgresql://ganjvezplkwnyf:c2ab9de3ce2ca931f13aa6e62667607ac5f19929425b7ef16a237fe61c664d97@ec2-34-198-189-252.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/dbjeqssrqgcj15 <br> <br>

To build, run and test on localhost or Heroku, follow the following steps:
1. git clone https://github.com/SoamyaAgrawal17/SAVS
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it. Command: python3 -m virtualenv venv > source venv/bin/activate 
4. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
5. python3 freeze> requirements.txt
6. python3 app.py
7. The application would run on port 5000
8. To deploy the code on Heroku, follow the instructions in the following reference link: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/heroku-deploy-your-flask-app-with-a-database-online-d19274a7a749 <br> 
9.  To run the code on local, postgres db has to be setup in local, and replace the
10.  To connect to your local database, replace app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] in app.py with 'postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/<db-name>'


- Manual Testing can be done by using the above Endpoint. <br>
- Unit Testing could be done by running the command coverage run -m unittest discover test or using push button to run all the unit tests. <br>
- For integration testing run the collection SAVS on Postman(The collection json is shared in the Postman workspace). <br>

To build client: <br>
  
  1. Install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  2. Alternative through Homebrew: brew install node
  3. Check if node is installed: node -v
  4. Add your Google Client ID in index2.html
  5. Go to SAVS/client and run: node app.js
  6. Open Chrome in Guest mode or any other browser after logging out from google accounts and go to http://localhost:8080
